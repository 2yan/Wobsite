  <h3> Direct micro-financing</h3>
  <ul class="productlist">
    <li>
      <h4>We negotiate with brokers to keep the rates low</h4>
      With most other finance providers your broker will take a 10% cut of the total financed amount.
      We, if the client is applying for our direct micro financing, do not allow the broker to
      charge such high fees to the client. </li>
    <li>
      <h4> We don't charge any surprise closing fees.</h4>
      Everything is clearly laid out, no surprises. </li>
    <li>
      <h4> We take the time to analyze each business thoroughly </h4>
      Even if you just need $2,000 or even $500 dollars. We take the time to listen and understand your
      business. We understand that business are made of people and can have different special
      circumstances.
      There is not such thing as a restricted industry for us, we will take the time to listen to why your
      business is going to succeed in its goals,
      we learn everything we can about you. We don't just make you fit into a simple model that rejects
      you just because you're from one industry or have some unrelated factor. </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Our qualification criteria is transparent and simple</h4>
      All we need to do is establish if you are making money consistently OR have a sure fire payment coming
      in and that's it.
      Even if your revenue isn't consistent, if your revenue is seasonal and we can see evidence of that, we
      will likely be happy to fund you. </li>
