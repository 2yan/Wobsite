    <li> -Interest is calculated at the end of each compounding period.  </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

<p> This assumes a very straightforward loan. As such this is only an estimate of what the costs are going to be like.
    Please talk to your loan provider to figure out exactly what the conditions of your loan are.</p>
