<h2>What is revenue funding?</h2>
<h3>What is the definition of revenue-based funding?</h3>

<p>Despite popular belief, revenue-based funding is not a loan. Unlike loans, which are the lending of a lump sum of money to be paid back over time with interest, revenue-based funding is the purchase of future income against current cash flows. While this may sound similar to a loan, there are a few major differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revenue funding faces different regulatory standards than loans. Revenue funding tends to have less government involvement than traditional loans.</li>
<li>Income flow is more important than credit score for revenue based cash. This means that if your business is <b>generating revenue</b>, you can get cash for investment with a bad or no credit score.</li>
<li>Revenue funding, unlike traditional loans, <b>does not have compounding interest</b>. Instead, you pay a single, one-time fee. This means that <b>you are not charged more interest over time</b>.</li>
<li>Revenue funding can also be used by companies which don't qualify for bank loans, such as restaurants, small retailers, and other borrowers.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, credit score is only a secondary factor in determining eligibility.</li>
<li>Revenue funding instruments are purchased as a function of a business's daily income. Whereas banks require monthly payments of relatively large amounts, revenue funding lenders take a daily percentage of credit card sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest advantages of revenue funding is that you <b>do not pay compounding interest</b>. The interest rate on revenue-based financing is just a <b>flat fee</b>. With traditional loans, seemingly low interest rates can add up to much higher rates over time due to compounding. To clarify this, consider the following example:</p>
<p>Jeannette needs extra money for her small business. She qualifies for both revenue funding and a bank loan. The revenue funding has a simple rate of 40% and the bank loan has an APR of 12%, compounded monthly. Which one should she get?</p>
<ul>
<li>The revenue funding rate will <b>always be 40%</b> no matter how long Jeannette takes to pay it off.</li>
<li>Assuming Jeannette doesn't pay any of her loans off, the bank loan will have an actual interest rate of <b>82% after 5 years, 160% after 8 years</b>, and <b>230% after 10 years</b>. This puts Jeannette under a lot of pressure to pay off her bank loan as soon as possible. <b>There is no such pressure with a revenue funding option.</b>
</ul>
<p>As we see here, despite having a higher apparent fee rate, revenue funding is very competitive <b>over longer time frames.</b></p>
<p>Finally, a good partner will price the daily payment amount low enough that it shouldn't impact business.

<h3>The simple explanation:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are advanced cash and you pay back the cash plus a fee.</li>
<li>To make things easier, the size of your payments is determined by your revenue per day.</li>
<li>The amount you owe does not increase over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>For example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are lent $100.</li>
<li>You are charged a 10% fee. Unlike regular loans, this fee does not compound.</li>
<li>You now need to pay back $110. You pay the debt back based on your revenue. If you normally make $10, you pay back $0.10. If you make $20, you pay back $0.20.</li>
<li>Your debt does not increase with time, and bookkeeping is kept simple.</li>
</ul>
