<h1> Everything you need to know about SBA Loans.</h1>
<h2>What is an SBA Loan?</h2>
    <p> In Summary an SBA Loan is: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>- Like regular loan for businesses</li>
    <li>- Long term rather than short term debt</li>
    <li>- Obtained from a private lender (not from the government)</li>
    <li>- Cheaper than a regular loan because if you default the SBA will pay off some of the debt for you</li>
    </ul>

<h2> What are the qualification criteria for SBA Loans? </h2>
    <p> That depends on which specific loan you're getting and that depends on the following factors: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> What your business size is</li>
        <li> If you qualify for any special aid</li>
        <li> How quickly you want the money</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Generally it's safe to assume that you need to have 620 + Credit Score and make over 150k per year.
