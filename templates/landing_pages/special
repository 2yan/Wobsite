<h2>Funding Options for a Legal Marijuana Business</h2>
<p>If you are interested in getting funding for a legal marijuana business, there are some basic requirements of which you should be aware. These basic requirements are:​​</p>
<ul>
<li>Your business must be located in a state where such a business is legal.</li>
<li>Your business must be registered with the state in which the business is located.</li>
<li>You must have a business bank account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve cleared these hurdles, you are now ready to start seeking financing for your marijuana business. A word of warning: Financing your marijuana business can be more challenging than for other types of businesses. Although your business is legal in your state,  financing options more difficult because marijuana is still considered federally illegal. This doesn't apply to associated businesses. i.e. Suppose you're a business that sells fertilizers primarily to <i>legal</i> marijuana growers, you can get a loan just like any other a business. These stipulations are only if you're directly involved with the plant.</p>
<p>So out of the major loan types found <a href="http://www.aldoracapital.com/get-estimate-or-apply">here</a>, the <a href="http://www.aldoracapital.com/sba-loan-guide">SBA loan</a>, because it is backed by the government, would not be an option. Additionally, a term loan, aka a run-of-the-mill loan, that is backed by a conventional bank might also be difficult to obtain because there is not enough data on the marijuana business industry to assess risk. So, we've put this quick guide together for you to understand what's available for you how it all works.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.aldoracapital.com/what-is-revenue-based-funding">Revenue Funding</a></h3>
<p>Revenue funding is not a regular loan in the conventional sense. It's a loan in that you get money, and you pay it back with a fixed fee on top of what you borrow. But that's where the similarities end:  Revenue based funding is the purchase of future income against current cash flows. So basically, you get some cash from your lender based on how much money you're making month to month or day to day, but instead of paying interest that compounds over time, the fee rate is fixed. If you borrow $100 and owe $110, you will only owe a maximum of $110, it won't become $112 after 3 months because of interest compounding.</p>
<p>Here's a quick summary of the option:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory requirements for revenue funding differ from those of traditional loans. There is less government involvement in revenue based funding. </li>
<li>There is no compounding interest with revenue funding. You pay a one-time flat fee for the money you are receiving.</li>
<li>Collateral is not required.</li>
<li>You can obtain revenue based funding even if your credit score isn’t that great. This is because the income your business generates is more important than your credit score</li>
<li>Revenue funding is a great option for businesses, such as a marijuana business, that are not able to obtain traditional financing.</li>
<li>You generally get approved and financed quick if you make consistent income. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re interested in revenue funding for your marijuana business, then your business must generate at least $10,000 per month in revenue. You will also need to have been in business at least six months and have a business bank account. If your business meets these requirements, then revenue funding might be a good option for you, depending on your needs.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.aldoracapital.com/personal-loan">Personal Loan</a></h3>
<p>A personal loan might be an option for financing your marijuana business. You may need collateral for this type of loan. If you do decide to go with this option, remember that it is important that you keep your personal finances separate from your business finances, even if your business is operating as an S-corp. A personal loan is a potentially good option if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a credit score of 680 or higher</li>
<li>Prefer to borrow as an individual instead of a business</li>
</ul>
<p>A personal loan is beneficial because it is flexible regarding the term, interest rate and amount borrowed. You can use the money as a start-up loan for your business. It can also be used as a personal or business line of credit. We don't really recommend taking this option because keeping your business finances separate from your personal ones is always a good idea.

<h3><a href="http://www.aldoracapital.com/small-business-line-of-credit">Small Business Line of Credit</a></h3>
<p>The line of credit is exactly what it's name implies, and it works very simply: you log into a website, pick how much money you want, the website tells you the borrowing fee, and the money is instantly deposited into your bank account. The application process is incredibly simple: You connect your bank account up to the web portal: From there, the amount of money for which you are qualified is based on your deposits and expenses. You will know instantly how much money you will have available and will have access to the money in as little as 48 hours. On top of all there is neither a minimum credit score limit, nor is there a check. Very quick, very modern money.  Because it's all about your business bank statements, industry stipulations are nonexistent.</p>
<p>A small business line of credit is an option if you want to borrow money as you need it. You must have a business bank account and generate at least $30,000 in revenue per year to use this funding source. The biggest benefit with a small business line of credit is that you can have money at your fingertips pretty much whenever you want it. </p>
<h3>Final Notes</h3>
<p>Generally we encourage people to try for the best product that they qualify for, even if that makes us less money, and in this case that would mean we would recommend going for the small business line of credit, and if that doesn't work out/ doesn't give enough money, consider the revenue funding. The personal loan, while technically being an option, should really be a nothing more than a last resort. Although you will probably be better off in the long run just waiting it out.</p>
